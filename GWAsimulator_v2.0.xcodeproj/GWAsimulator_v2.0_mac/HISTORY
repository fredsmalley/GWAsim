Version history of GWAsimulator


November 19, 2007:  Version 2.0 posted.

1.  Added a feature that allows the effect of each disease locus to be
    different from multiplicative.  This requires a format change of the
    control file from previous versions.
2.  Added a feature that allows the user to specify two-way
    interaction effects between pairs of disease loci.
3.  Fixed a bug (see below).
4.  Added a check on the number of arguments in the command line.  If
    it is not 2, a brief explanation of syntax is printed.
5.  Added a copyright file.



Bugs found in version 1.1:

1.  When simulating the case genotypes at disease loci, an indexing
    error (due to a coding typo) caused all case genotypes at diseaes
    loci to be 0/0.


November 15, 2007:  Paper published online.
October 29, 2007:  Paper accepted by Bioinformatics.


October 10, 2007:  Version 1.1 minor modifications.

1.  Added file detection for existent chr#.dat and chr#.dat.gz when
    the data output option is used.  If any such file exists, the
    program prints out a warning message about removing these files.
2.  Added more discussions in the Properties and Limitations section
    of the program manual.
3.  Provided supplementary materials on the program web site. (1)
    Evaluation of simulated data using LDU maps.  (2) Comparison with
    results from the program hapgen.


September 21, 2007:  Version 1.1 posted.

1.  Fixed bugs (see below) and added more error checks.
2.  Added a feature to allow a disease locus on X chromosome.
3.  Added a feature to allow simulation of chromosomal regions.
4.  Revised the program manual to reflect the new features and to
    include more details.
5.  Compiled all executables using g++ 3.4 or later.
6.  Included a universal executable file for MacOS.
7.  Included this history file.
8.  Provided example input files for HumanHap300 and HumanHap550 on
    program web site.



Bugs found in version 1.0:

1.  When calculating the cummulative conditional probabilities in function
    cum_disease_geno(), the formula for control probabilities were wrong.
    The correct formula should have /(1-PREV) at the end instead of /PREV.
2.  For non-disease chromosomes, starting locus genotype frequencies
    were flipped for the two alleles and were wrong for X for males
    (function sample_start_marker()).
3.  In file output:
    linkage option:  first female control would be output as a male control
    genotype option:  X genotypes for males would be 0 or 1, not 0 or 2


July 25, 2007:  Version 1.0 minor modifications.

1.  Corrected typos in Illumina300KCEU/README.
2.  Changed the file compression command in data output function from
    "/bin/rm -f %s.gz; gzip %s" to "gzip -f %s".
3.  Added to the Windows version three new files for the gzip function:
    gzip.exe, copygzip.bat, README.txt
